When running gunicorn, binding it with 0.0.0.0:<port> in order to expose port to outside. If not, the loopback IP (127.0.0.1 or localhost) is used.
This makes gunicorn container cannot be accessed from Nginx reverse proxy.

Must change ALLOWED_HOSTS of Django to '*' so that Django will not cancel passed requests form Nginx.

Template of a Nginx configuration file for reverse proxy:

# this is simple version of conf file for Nginx working with Gunicorn

upstream webapp{
  server gunicorndjnet:8000 # this is an alias of container in network
}
server {
    # use 'listen 80 deferred;' for Linux
    # use 'listen 80 accept_filter=httpready;' for FreeBSD
    listen 80 default_server;
    client_max_body_size 4G;

    # set the correct host(s) for your site
    server_name example.com www.example.com;

    keepalive_timeout 5;

    # path for static files
    root /djapp/static;

    location / {
      # checks for static file, if not found proxy to app
        proxy_pass http://webapp/;
    }

}
